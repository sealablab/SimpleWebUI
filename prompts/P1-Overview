# P1 - Project Overview

**VoloApp** is a hardware abstraction layer for deploying FPGA applications to Moku platform with human-friendly register interfaces. At present it supports a **very** limited set of 'volo-app' compatible types. 

## VOLO-APP datatypes (current)

| Type | Pydantic Enum | VHDL Type | Bit Range | Value Range |
|------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **8-bit Counter** | `COUNTER_8BIT` | `std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)` | `(7 downto 0)` | 0-255 |
| **Percent** | `PERCENT` | `std_logic_vector(6 downto 0)` | `(6 downto 0)` | 0-100 |
| **Button** | `BUTTON` | `std_logic` | `(0)` | 0 or 1 |


## MOKU-Models
A set of pydantic models describing the MCC infrastructure is located at ./models/moku_models

## VOLO-Models
A set of pydantic models describing the MCC infrastructure is located at ./models/volo_models

## VOLO-App example
A sample manifest file is located at 
@DS1120-PD_app.yaml


## Your task:
I would like you to help me select a framework that can
- auto-generate simple web-uis given 
a) an input manifest file 
b) access to the relevant pydantic models

## Priorities
Chosen framework should:

### P1: Be modern python 3.10+ 
 - integrate nicely with the tech stack layed out in @pyproject.toml

 - provide quick iteration

 - supporting generating a text based UI would be a big plus
